## Devotionals

## Games

Fun group games to play virtually or in-person.

### Virtual

#### [Fishbowl](https://fishbowl-game.com/)

> Fishbowl is a virtual version of a fun (and mostly hilarious) guessing game, designed for any group of all ages! You'll need at least 4 to play, but it only gets more fun with more players. Hop on a video call, and play through rounds of Taboo, Charades, and Password.

#### [Just Dance](https://www.youtube.com/user/justdancegame)

> Just Dance is a dance rhythm game. Players must mimic the on-screen dancer's choreography to a chosen song using either motion controllers or the game's associated smartphone app.

#### [Skribbl](https://skribbl.io/)

> skribbl.io is a free multiplayer drawing and guessing game.
 One game consists of a few rounds in which every round someone has to 
 draw their chosen word and others have to guess it to gain points!
 The person with the most points at the end of game will then be crowned 
 as the winner!

#### [Spy Fall](https://netgames.io/games/spyfall/)

> Discover who the spy is by asking careful questions. All except the spy share a crucial piece of knowledge: the location of this strange meeting. Use this knowledge to weed the spy out, but don't let them discover your location or the consequences will be dire. 

### In-Person

#### [Camp Games](https://www.ultimatecampresource.com/camp-games/)

> When everyone plays, we all win! Age-appropriate, and interactive games for youth camps. These activities use the "everybody plays - everybody wins" philosophy. Whenever possible, don't keep score, change the rules, and most of all - have fun!

## Ice Breakers

Break the ice with these activities.

#### Desert Island

> You've been exiled to a deserted island for a year. In addition to the essentials, you may take one piece of music, one book (no religious text) and one luxury item you can carry with you i.e. not a boat or cell phone tower! Allow a few minutes for the participants to draw up their list of three items and collect and mix up choices. Randomly hand out choices and ask people to guess who made the choices.

#### [Quick Questions Game](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d6suolF0jxH5533h-AxTvcRlRYlqELzpQnrxpHErhQ8/edit#slide=id.p)

> Questions to ask to spark conversations and form connections. Make your own. 
Questions are hidden on the slide. Pick a number and remove the top image to 
reveal the question.

#### Scavenger Hunt

> Find some things in your house that you made, brings you hope, that motivates you, something you have the longest ... come you with your own questions. Use `google timer` for a countdown.

#### Virtues Board

> What qualities and attitudes help us learn together? Have participants post qualities and attitudes on a white board, e.g. https://jamboard.google.com/.
