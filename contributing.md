## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, we'll ask you to edit your pull request (PR) before it is included. If we notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we include it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
